Creating permissionless wallet innovation

## Overview

At Rhinestone, we’re building a platform that facilitates module development, from development frameworks and third-party tooling, all the way through to automated audits and installation on the user’s account. We provide distribution through a module marketplace and turnkey business models for monetization.

Our developer stack:

- ModuleKit: A development framework to streamline the process of building, testing and deploying modules for different smart account implementations
- WalletKit: An integration kit that allows wallets to use third-party modular components in their UI
- Module Registry: A permissionless registry that allows developers to register their modules and auditors to attest to their security
