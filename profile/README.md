Creating permissionless wallet innovation

## Overview

At Rhinestone, we’re building a platform that facilitates smart account module development, from quick start frameworks and third-party tooling, all the way through to guided audits and installation on the user’s account. We provide distribution through a module marketplace and turn key business modules for monetization.

Our role doesn’t just start and end with onchain innovation. We believe that in order to bring module applications to life, developers need access to UI components and sandboxed areas within the wallet application in order to marry onchain innovation with tailored, wallet native, UX.

Our developer stack:

- ModuleKit: A development framework to streamline the process of building, testing and deploying modules for different smart account implementations
- WalletKit: An integration kit that allows wallets to use third-party modular components in their UI
- Module Registry: A permissionless registry that allows developers to register their modules and auditors to attest to their security
